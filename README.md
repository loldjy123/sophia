Sophia is a visual-first AI tutor that explains complex algorithm step by step using visuals, explanations, and questions.

# 🌸 Sophia — Visual-First AI Tutor

Sophia is an experimental **AI-powered, visual-first tutoring system** designed to help students actually understand complex topics — not just get answers.

Instead of dumping text or rushing through solutions, Sophia teaches like a human tutor:

- visually  
- step by step  
- with narration  
- questions  
- and interactive explanations  

The goal is simple: **learning that sticks.**

## ✨ Core Idea

Many existing tutorials (videos, blogs, even AI chats) suffer from one or more problems:

- You can’t ask questions at the right moment  
- Explanations move too fast or assume prior knowledge  
- Visuals are static or disconnected from the explanation  
- AI answers often shortcut thinking instead of building it  

**Sophia is built to solve this.**

She explains concepts as a **lesson**, not a reply.

## 🧠 What Sophia Does

Sophia can:

- Explain algorithms and technical concepts from scratch  
- Generate visual boards (SVG-based animations, diagrams, graphs)  
- Narrate explanations using natural voice  
- Pause, resume, and step through lessons  
- Ask conceptual questions at key moments (Socratic style)  
- Judge answers gently and give hints instead of spoilers  
- Let learners ask questions mid-lesson (text or voice)  

All of this happens inside a **single interactive learning canvas**.

## 🖥️ User Experience

- **Left sidebar**: Course Section 
- **Center screen**: the lesson board (visuals + progression)  
- **Bottom composer**: ask questions, speak, or generate lessons  
- **Controls**: play, pause, step forward/back, fullscreen  
- **Optional voice mode**: Sophia speaks, listens, and responds  

The interface is designed to feel closer to a **private tutor** than a chatbot.
